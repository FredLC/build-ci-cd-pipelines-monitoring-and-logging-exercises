# Overview

This repo contains the lesson material for the Build CI/CD Pipelines course. In it, you'll find folders for each lesson and their corresponding exercises. The exercise folder will contain the following:

1. A README.md to provide further details and instructions
2. A starter folder with any files or templates you should use to start your work
3. A solution folder that contains a working solution to the exercise that will be reviewed in the classroom
4. Other supplemental material like a frontend or backend application, will be provided in the root of the exercise folder. This is important to keep in mind when running commands in the pipeline.

As you work on each lesson, remember that in order for the Github Actions to trigger your workflow, the workflow files must be in the root of your repository under the `.github/workflows` folder. It is **highly recommended** to either disable any workflows you are done with (by commenting the entire file) as there is a **2000 minute limit per month** for Github Actions for public repositories.
